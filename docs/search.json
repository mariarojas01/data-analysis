    "text": "1.1 Assupmtions\nAccording to Ernst and Albers (2017) there are 4 assupmtions in the linear regression model, violating these assumptions can create several kinds of problems. First, the resulting estimates may be biased, meaning they do not,reflect the true population values. Second, the estimators might become inconsistent, so increasing the sample size no longer estimates will approach the true parameters. Third, may lose its efficiency, meaning it can yield less precise estimates. Fourth, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals may become unreliable. Note that these assumptions specifically apply to estimation using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method (a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values), which is the default in many statistical software programs.\n\nLinearity: The model assumes a linear and additive relationship between each predictor and the mean of the dependent variable, with errors averaging zero for any combination of predictors. Problems arise if relationships are nonlinear or if measurement error is present. Multicollinearity is not an assumption, but low overlap between predictors is desirable. (Ernst & Albers, 2017)\nNormality: The model errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution centered at zero. (Ernst & Albers, 2017)\nHomoscedasticity: The errors are expected to have constant variance across all values of the predictors. If the spread of errors changes (heteroscedasticity), the assumption is violated. (Ernst & Albers, 2017)\nIndependence: Errors must be independent of each other, meaning their covariances are zero. This requires proper random sampling. Residual plots or autocorrelation checks help detect issues. (Ernst & Albers, 2017)"
