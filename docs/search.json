    "text": "4.1 Multicollinearity\nAccording to Daoud (2017) multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated, which leads to an increase in the standard errors of the estimated coefficients. When standard errors become inflated, some or all coefficients may no longer appear significantly different from zero, meaning variables that should be statistically meaningful can incorrectly seem insignificant."

(2013) offers further explanation:\n\nResiduals: the difference between what the model predicts and what actually happened.\nIntercept: is the model’s prediction of the outcome when all predictors are 0\nEstimated coefficients (Estimate): This tells you how much the outcome changes when a predictor increases by 1 unit, while the others stay the same.\nt-values and p-values: These are used to test if an estimated coefficient is statistically different from zero. The t-value indicates how far the estimate is from zero in terms of standard errors, and the p-value shows the probability of obtaining such a result if the true coefficient were actually zero.\nResidual standard error: This is the average size of prediction errors.\nMultiple R-squared: measures how well the regression model explains the variability in the dependent variable.\nF-statistic: checks if the whole model (all predictors together) is useful."

When the residuals are evenly scattered around a flat horizontal line with no clear shape or trend, it suggests that the model fits well. (Kim, 2015)\nNormal Q-Q: This plot shows if residuals are normally distributed. Points should follow the diagonal line if residuals are approximately normal. (Kim, 2015)\nScale-Location: shows if residuals are spread equally along the ranges of predictors. This is how you can check homoscedasticity. It’s good if you see a horizontal line with randomly spread points.(Kim, 2015)\nResiduals vs Leverage: it spots influential data points that can strongly affect the regression results. The focus is on points that appear in the upper-right or lower-right areas of the plot or fall outside the dashed lines.(Kim, 2015)"
